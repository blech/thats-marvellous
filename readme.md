# That's Marvellous

A Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of the A word (not that one, the one that's overused by Californians to describe things that are good) with a much better old-fashioned synonym.

## Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag thats-marvellous.crx into the page that appears.

## TODO

The extension prefers British to American English. I should make that optional.
